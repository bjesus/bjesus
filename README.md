Hey! I love writing software that makes my life easier.

🐧 I use Sway on Arch Linux, and so I wrote [wttrbar](https://github.com/bjesus/wttrbar) to show the weather, and [Clapboard](https://github.com/bjesus/clapboard) to manage my clipboard.

📚 I run PostmarketOS on my e-reader, so I assembled [AIR](https://github.com/bjesus/air) as an interface for it, and I wrote [Pidif](https://github.com/bjesus/pidif) as as simple touch-oriented PDF reader for it. I'm working on [Teatime](https://github.com/bjesus/teatime) to allow everyone access to books, and [Levin](https://github.com/bjesus/levin) to support Anna's Archive.

🎵 I like playing the guitar, so I've contributed a lot to [freetar](https://github.com/kmille/freetar) and I wrote [Eyeroll](https://github.com/bjesus/eyeroll) to scroll through chords easily. For listening to music I use Tidal, for which I wrote [TidalFS](https://github.com/bjesus/tidalfs).

🦊 I love Firefox and I use it with my own custom UI, [Fireside](https://github.com/bjesus/fireside). To easily access all the different webapps I run locally, I'm using [Levin](https://github.com/bjesus/baywatch).

💻 I spend most of my computer time with the terminal, so I wrote [Wren](https://github.com/bjesus/wren) to manage my notes and TODOs, [Muxile](https://github.com/bjesus/muxile) to transfer my tmux sessions to my phone, [swe](https://github.com/bjesus/swe) to help me while studying Swedish, and [pipet](https://github.com/bjesus/pipet) to scrape websites easily.

🗓️ I work at Cloudflare but I have my personal calendar elsewhere, so wrote [Callibella](https://github.com/bjesus/callibella) to sync them. I wrote [OAuth Hopper](https://github.com/bjesus/oauth-hopper) to let me access oauth-gated resources with simple CLI tools.
